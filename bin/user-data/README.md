# Purpose of startup.sh

This script should be run the first time your flare node is started.

It bootstraps the system.

## Dependencies

This script assumes you're following installation instructions from the [Flare Readme](https://gitlab.com/flarenetwork/flare).

- You're running on Ubuntu 20.04.
- The script is running as root (as it would when a [user-data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html) script is called on the first system startup).
